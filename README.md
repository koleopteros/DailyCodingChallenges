# Daily Coding Challenges

## Purpose:
Improve my own problem solving skills and to force myself to find my own solutions.

## Structure:
Each problem with be in its self contained directory.
Problems will organized by source and date.

## Rules for my solutions:
 - Attempt for a solution regardless of how janky.
 - Create a second, more refined solution.
 - Aim for single pass.
 - Do not look up solutions from other users.
 - Only use documentation, NO stackoverflow nor the likes.

## Uploads:
 - Will use KoleosRemote when completing solutions on a Remote Desktop or from public PCs
 - For some reason my laptop's git desktop submits it as SlidyKlops (an older account), even though I've changed my credentials... Not sure why, but I don't care enough to bother with fixing it.

### INCOMPLETE PROBLEMS:
