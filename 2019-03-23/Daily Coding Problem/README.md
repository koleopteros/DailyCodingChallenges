# Problem

This problem was asked by Apple.

Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, and calls f after n milliseconds.

# Comments
Seems potentially easy.

Sounds like a function that will call another function after n milliseconds have passed... Basically setTimeout in JavaScript...

IF using another language, I don't know.  perhaps I'd have to learn whether other languages can pass callback functions the same way Javascript can, then go from there.

I suppose they can since javaScript does compile down to another language (C or C++?)

# Next step
Learn how to do this using a lower level language.
