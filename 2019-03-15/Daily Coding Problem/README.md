# The Problem
This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

## Summary
Ex 1
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [120,60,40,30,24]
Ex 2
Input: [3,2,1]
Output: [2,3,6]

## This challenge was delayed

I didn't get around to doing this since it comes in at noon and I was working on a project from ~8am - 10pm.  I wish it came earlier.

Since it comes at Noon, I think I will be doing these the following day.  Mostly because I want to get practice in during the morning rather in the evening.
