### Decided to do a bonus one since today's challenge was too similar to yesterday's

# Two Sums (Easy)

## Very similar to 3-14-19 dailyCodingProblem, only difference is the return

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

> Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
>
> Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
> return [0, 1].

# Bonus: Matrix Rotation

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

Note:

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

### notes regarding bonus question
I don't like my solution as it is.  Look into an algorithm that doesn't just push and "pop" rows in and out.
